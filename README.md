# Blackboard

This project utilizes the technology of Leap Motion to create amazing, unique drawings that capture the spontanous creativity within everyone. 

## Tackling the Creative Community 
Our team looked forward to designing a product for the arts community, since we thought there was a lack of VR/motion tracking in this field. The idea originally was focused on helping teachers upload their notes and achieve a "smartboard", however that did not seem feasable with the hardware we were given. 

## Technical Aspects ##
The application runs on the web and is written in node.js. It makes use of the express framework, and uses the javascript canvas in order to create the drawings. The application is hosted on an azure instance in the cloud.
